XBoost
======

XBoost is an exetremely fast ada-boost library implemented in Matlab and Python 3.

The goal is to provide fast language-specific boosting libraries with minimum runtime requirement. For example, our Python 3 library requires the numpy library, while our Matlab library requires literally nothing other than an installed version of Matlab/Octave.

It is still under active development. Contribution is welcomed!
